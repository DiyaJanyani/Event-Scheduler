The project is based on event-scheduling dome in colleges using real-time database Firebase where committee head can add event, check if any vent is already planned.

The principal can approve or reject the events. The approved and rejected events will be reflected back on committee headâ€™s domain. 

The students can view the events which are approved and finalised with the dates and details about the event.

This helps to avoid the clashes between events.
